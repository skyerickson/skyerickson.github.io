<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 3 1/2 pint shallow oven-proof dish. Grate the zest from 2 of the lemons, then squeeze the juice of all 3. Cream the butter with the sugar and lemon zest. Beat in the egg yolks one by one. The mixture may curdle.</li>

<li>Next, beat in the flour a spoonful at a time, alternating with splashes of milk and lemon juice. Once it is all in, whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks, and fold lightly into the lemon batter.</li>

<li>
Pour the mixture into the baking dish, then stand the dish in a roasting tin. Pour enough boiling water around the dish to ome about halfway up the sides. Bake in the oven for 40 to 45 minutes or until the pudding is golden brown. Serve hot or warm, with or without cream.</li>
